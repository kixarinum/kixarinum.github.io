I am a full-stack developer from Kyiv(Ukraine).
I am involved in development since 2010 and have a solid knowledge of design patterns, OOP, OOD principles, and building DB architectures. This knowledge allowed me to successfully develop applications from scratch
and maintain existing solutions.

On my web and other projects I was involved in developing of front- and back-end, using:
 - Node.js,
 - ReactJS
 - Ruby,
 - Ruby on Rails
 - Sinatra,
 - Python,
 - JavaScript and other JS libraries and technology stacks.

I love to lie on the beach or walk with my dog during my free time.
